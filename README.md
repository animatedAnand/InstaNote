## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello! I am Abhayanand Kumar.

I am currently a student at IIIT Gwalior enrolled in a 5 years' integrated course of B.Tech. in Information Technology & MBA. The course will be completed by April/May 2023.

I love coding. I have thoroughly learnt Data Structure & Algorithms and solved over 2500+ questions on popular coding platforms like Codechef,Leetcode,Codeforces,AtCoder,GeeksForGeeks etc.

I have also developed a fascination for Android App development and working on some cool ideas. I find software development a really interesting job and I am open to learn any new technology as per the requirements.

I am looking forward to join a dynamic company where I can learn a lot new things and contribute effectively in the software development domain.
